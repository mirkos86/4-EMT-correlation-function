# 4 EMT correlation function

This is a collection of the files I developed in order to perform and test the explicit calculation of the 4-point function
of the stress energy tensor in a free conformal field theory in 4 spacetime dimensions.

Just load them up and run them in Mathematica (version 10.1 or higher). 

Calculations of the 2 and 3 point functions are detailed as well, in order to prvide a framework in which the reader can 
familiarize with the tools employes and with the ideas underpinning the calculations and their tests, if she/he is not yet 
familiar with them.

Plase note that some of the calculations can be quite time consuming and that the numerical checks of the Ward identities for 
the 4 point function requires your computer to have least 25 GB of memory at its disposal in order not to crush.
